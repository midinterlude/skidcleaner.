> Built with Python for comprehensive system cleaning and privacy protection. Designed specifically for Roblox users who need advanced anti-detection capabilities.

> [!WARNING]
> **Attention:** This tool is intended for educational and legitimate privacy protection purposes only. Use responsibly and in accordance with platform terms of service.

> [!NOTE]
> Slate requires a configuration file to function properly. Visit the [configuration page](https://midinterlude.github.io/slate) to generate your personalized `slate.config.json` file.

> [!TIP]
> For maximum effectiveness, run Slate as administrator and consider restarting your system after cleaning to ensure all changes take effect.

Have you been struggling with Roblox alt detection and need a comprehensive solution to protect your privacy?

With the increasing sophistication of detection systems, users need advanced tools that can thoroughly clean digital footprints and provide network-level protection. Traditional cleaning methods often miss critical traces that can be used for identification.

> But, what about having a tool that handles everything from file cleaning to MAC address spoofing?

Perhaps you've tried basic cleaners that only scratch the surface. They leave behind registry entries, prefetch files, cookies, and network identifiers that can still be used to track you. **Slate provides a complete solution: deep system cleaning, network spoofing, and automated Roblox management**.

## Recent Updates

- [Slate v3.0 Release](https://github.com/midinterlude/Slate) - Complete rewrite with enhanced error handling and logging
- [ByeBanAsync Integration](https://github.com/midinterlude/Slate) - Added MAC address spoofing capabilities
- [Configuration System](https://midinterlude.github.io/slate) - Web-based configuration generator for easy setup
- [Enhanced Logging](https://github.com/midinterlude/Slate) - Detailed operation logging with error tracking

## What Makes Slate Special?

Unlike other cleaning tools that focus only on basic file deletion, Slate was built with **comprehensive privacy protection** as the primary goal.

> [!TIP]
> Worried about incomplete cleaning leaving traces behind?
>
> Don't worry! Slate uses multiple layers of cleaning including file deletion, registry cleanup, process termination, DNS flushing, and network adapter spoofing. The multi-vector approach ensures maximum privacy protection.

This means that **Slate provides complete digital footprint elimination** covering files, registry entries, network identifiers, and application data. The configurable nature allows users to customize the cleaning process to their specific needs.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Slate is perfect for users who need comprehensive privacy protection and anti-detection capabilities.
>
> It's ideal if you're concerned about:
>
> - Account tracking and linking
> - Digital fingerprinting
> - Network-level identification
